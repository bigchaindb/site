Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?

# Shinier than yours, meatbag.

I don't want to be rescued. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Also Zoidberg. Fatal. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Moving along… Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Ummm…to eBay? You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Belligerent and numerous.

* We're rescuing ya.
* I never loved you.
* What are their names?

This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

## When will that be?

File not found. Negative, bossy meat creature! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Anyone who laughs is a communist!
