## Background

[BenBen](http://benben.com.gh)’s founders, Daniel Bloch and Emmanuel Noah were early true believers in Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Both worked at Bitbox, the second Bitcoin exchange in North America, at its inception while at the University of Michigan in 2013. Daniel also cofounded the Blockchain Education Network, a US nonprofit that still exists.

While attending an event at the University of Kenya, they became aware of the land and property rights issues endemic to much of Africa and focused their efforts on addressing these in Ghana.

## Challenges

It is virtually impossible to collateralize property rights in Ghana because there is no meaningful registry of land ownership. The lack of a registry meant payments could never be facilitated. Land records that are recorded, sit in a centralized database with no additional benefits than a paper registry. Payment transactions are not accurately recorded. This results in an ongoing cycle of poverty, in which much of the population is never able to emerge, due to unattainable property rights and the  financial leverage and credit such rights generate.

## Solution

Utilizing blockchain technology, BenBen is creating a top-of-stack land registry CRM tool and verification platform for  financial institutions that provides verified data related to transactions. BenBen will work with these institutions to update current registries and enable smart transactions and private keys in order to allow for an automated chain of property transactions between all parties.

## How BigchainDB is helping

- BigchainDB has worked with BenBen to provide solutions and guidance around the integration of IPFS for document storage and the construction of a blockchain database using BigchainDB technology.
- In so doing, BigchainDB has facilitated the agile development of the BenBen product - essentially supplying all of the technological and development tools.
- By leveraging BigchainDB, BenBen will allow for the management of data, enable reporting, smart land transactions, queries and analytics.
- BigchainDB’s scalability facilitates the database to hold all attributed data including zone, acreage, usage, ownership, occupation and more.

## Looking ahead

The BenBen team is in conversations with organizations in Nigeria, Mozambique, and Colombia to identify potential markets where the same system could be launched after Ghana.
