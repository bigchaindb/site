## Background

[Recruit Technologies](http://recruit-tech.co.jp) is a subsidiary company of [Recruit Holdings Co.](http://www.recruit-rgf.com), a leading information services and human resources company in Japan.

Focusing on efforts on IT and R&D, Recruit Technologies explores new technologies and trends.
Using HR data as the pilot, the purpose of these tests is to investigate the possibilities and practical uses of how blockchain can be applied to the sector. A prototype resume authentication database for job hunters and employers alike is the first phase.

## Challenges

- Fraud within HR can manifest in several ways including forged or altered documentation to completely falsified documents like transcripts and employment records. Translated documents are also high risk as many are mistranslated, intentionally or otherwise, to misrepresent or mislead the original context.

- The process of applying for jobs online is manual and time-consuming for job seekers having to upload CVs and transcripts is inefficient.

- Companies have no way to verify documents they receive from applicants.

## Solution

- While sharing personal data with the user is seen as a competitive advantage to Recruit Technologies, the data needs to be maintained via very strict security operations that traditionally come at a huge cost. With blockchain technology allows for data to be encrypted and secure while also accessible and verifiable.

- A public blockchain database allows third parties to connect and share data in a secure manner.

## How BigchainDB is helping

A CV sharing web platform [was built with the ascribe API](https://www.ascribe.io/annoucements/recruit-technologies-applies-blockchain-technology-to-the-hr-industry-through-strategic-alliance-with-ascribe/) as a first step and then stored on BigchainDB. BigchainDB is providing the scalability needed for all of Recruit Technologies’s data, a feature lacking in traditional blockchains. Having all data written onto BigchainDB also greatly reduces their own security costs.

By leveraging BigchainDB’s technology, fraud is easily detectable, making it easier to address and reduce fraud on a large scale and in turn benefit their customers.

## Looking ahead

A platform for more detailed university and high school transcripts is being looked at as a potential next step. Recording the maintenance status of cars and sharing the data between owners and dealerships is also currently being explored.
