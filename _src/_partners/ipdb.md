IPDB is a global database for everyone, everywhere. It is built with identity and creators in mind. It allows the management of personal data, reputation, and privacy, along with secure attribution, metadata, licensing, and links to media files. Itâ€™s also flexible: the ultimate applications are up to users' imaginations, for everything from equal-opportunity banking to energy innovation.

To make this a reality, the IPDB Foundation will research and implement a decentralized database platform and governance model that allows the decentralized, permanent storage of data independent of a central entity, that anyone can use.
