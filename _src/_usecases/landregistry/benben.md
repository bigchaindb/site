## Background

[BenBen](http://benben.com.gh) is a team of motivated engineers and innovators dedicated to improving government technology in Ghana, BenBen is a digital land database that leverages blockchain technology to provide fast easy access to trusted land content. Focusing on land and property management, BenBen aims to create a reliable land information and transactions system by coupling the latest in geomatic services with blockchain technology.

## Challenges

It is virtually impossible to collateralize property rights in Ghana because there is no meaningful registry of land ownership. The lack of a registry meant payments could never be facilitated. Land records that are recorded, sit in a centralized database with no additional benefits than a paper registry. Payment transactions are not accurately recorded. This results in an ongoing cycle of poverty, in which much of the population is never able to emerge, due to unattainable property rights and the  financial leverage and credit such rights generate.

## Solution

Utilizing blockchain technology, BenBen is creating a top-of-stack land registry CRM tool and verification platform for  financial institutions that provides verified data related to transactions. BenBen will work with these institutions to update current registries and enable smart transactions and private keys in order to allow for an automated chain of property transactions between all parties.
