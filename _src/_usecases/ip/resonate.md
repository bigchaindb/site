about:
    user: "As a web developer since the 90’s, Peter Harris has built hundreds of sites, working with numerous musicians from struggling artists to mid-level bands and platinum-selling superstars. Simultaneous to his day job as web developer, Peter also experimented as a DJ and electronica producer. Finding many web and music publishing platforms lacking, this combination of background and insight is what led to the fundamental features being offered via Resonate."
    company: "Resonate is the world’s first streaming music cooperative with a totally new listening model called “stream to own.” Only paying for what you play, making a seamless transition from casual listening into becoming a dedicated fan. Resonate is a cooperative owned by the musicians, indie labels, fans and workers that build it."

## Background

[Peter Harris](https://resonate.is/profile/1/), a web developer and an electronic DJ and producer, always felt something was missing as both a music creator and fan.

A moment of clarity in the early days of the internet, made it clear all content would be distributed through the internet. He had a second moment of clarity with the rise of blockchain in the summer of 2014. He saw a chance and opportunity to move away from power hunger centers of commerce and build a new form of commerce and interaction. While researching payment models and royalties, he saw a huge disparity in the rates which inspired the stream to own concept.

## Challenges

- The current business models with both streaming and downloading do not serve the needs of the content creators.
- The relationship between corporations and labels are based on rigid contracts that don’t benefit the artists.
- Musicians and fans are shut of out the process as to how platforms run, operate and function.

## Solution

Utilizing blockchain technology and a democratic cooperative process means one member, one share, one vote. By building a metadata database and using micropayments, anyone can see exactly what was played and what needs to get paid in a very transparent manner.

## How BigchainDB is Helping

[Resonate](https://resonate.is/) is using [COALA IP](https://www.coalaip.org), a community-driven protocol for licensing intellectual property on the blockchain, written by a working group led by BigchainDB.

With COALA IP, the original content and authors are listed on the blockchain. Collaborating with other partners at [Envoke](https://envoke.org) allows us to extend that value beyond our own network.

BigchainDB’s ability to process massive amounts of data at high transaction speed facilitates the micropayments needed to support Resonate’s cooperative business model. Payments that can take years to process with traditional, more manual processes could be done instantly thanks to systems like BigchainDB.

Resonate’s value proposition to the music world is transparency which is facilitated by BigchainDB’s ability to put the history of what gets played and what gets paid into an immutable ledger as transactions which is publicly accessible to all.

## Looking Ahead

Content with multiple contributors and covers will also be supported to facilitate more efficient payment systems and collaboration. Localization features will also be built into the platform.
