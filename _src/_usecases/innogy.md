## Background

[innogy SE](www.innogy.com) is an European energy company. With its three business areas of Renewables, Grid & Infrastructure as well as Retail, it addresses the requirements of a modern, decarbonised, decentralised and digital world. The focus of innogy SE’s activities is on offering existing and potential customers innovative and sustainable products and services which enable them to use energy more efficiently and improve their quality of life.

## Challenges

Current supply-chain management is lacking efficiencies due to disparate component parts lacking provenance, traceability, and interoperability.

## Solution

By adding digital product memory to the component parts of items in the supply chain, a host of benefits emerge. For instance, each product receives a cryptographically secure ID and a digital product memory, which enables:

- Proof authenticity and ownership,
- Back-to-birth traceability of a product
- The ability to “talk” with each other
- The optimisation of the entire product life cycle - Future reproduction

Additionally, with the transparency the digital product memory is providing, via immutable data records stored in BigchainDB, the “trust tax” in supply chains can be radically reduced.
