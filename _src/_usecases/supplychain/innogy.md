## Background

[innogy SE](www.innogy.com), a large, multi-faceted energy company based dominantly in Europe, focuses on renewables, grids & infrastructure and retail.

Blockchain technology is utilized for, among other things:

- the logging of so-called “smart meter data”
- the creation of peer-to-peer energy cooperatives
- energy wholesaling
- confirmation, settlement, and billing
- “blockchainifying” micro-grids and energy flexibilities, such as batteries

As part of the Genesis of Things a a trusted, encrypted and open platform for the entire 3D printing supply chain is build up on blockchain technology. This approach allows Intellectual Property (IP) to scale globally and stay protected; each printed product has its own ID and digital product memory.

## Challenges

Current supply chain management is lacking efficiencies due to disparate component parts lacking provenance, traceability, and interoperability.

## Solution

By adding digital product memory to the component parts of items in the supply chain, a host of benefits emerge. For instance, each product receives a cryptographically secure ID and a digital product memory, which enables:

- Proof authenticity and ownership,
- Back-to-birth traceability of a product
- The ability to “talk” with each other
- The optimization of the entire product life cycle - Future reproduction

Additionally, with the transparency the digital product memory is providing, via immutable data records stored in BigchainDB, the “trust tax” in supply chains can be radically reduced.

## How BigchainDB is Helping

- ID numbers are written on to BigchainDB, giving physical pieces a digital product memory. Storing digital product memory in BigchainDB allows for querying.
- BigchainDB allows for the blockchainifying of other databases and has no single native language, meaning existing query languages can be used.
- Scalable infrastructure enables authenticated IoT data from their smart meters and batteries to be stored into the database to put their algorithms into the database.

## Looking Ahead

The Genesis of Things project envisions a future where everyone has access to manufacturing assets, open designs and supply chain data. The next step is to scale and market the digital product memory which leads to interoperability of trusted data records along the supply chain.
